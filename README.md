[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kms-key/releases).


```hcl
  module "kms_key" {
    source                  = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kms-key.git?ref=master"
    namespace               = "eg"
    stage                   = "test"
    name                    = "chamber"
    description             = "KMS key for chamber"
    deletion_window_in_days = 10
    enable_key_rotation     = true
    alias                   = "alias/parameter_store_key"
  }
```
